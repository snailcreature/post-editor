# Post Editor

This is a markdown post editor for the creation of posts for an upcoming
blog project I am working on.

It uses Next.js and React, as well as the Showdown markdown parser.

Current features include:

 - Markdown editing
 - Live HTML preview
 - Saving the rendered HTML as in a JSON format for page generation
 in React
 
Planned features include:

 - Image source mapping
 - An actual JSON output button
 - Mobile view support
 - An open button
 - Dark mode
 - Page content links
